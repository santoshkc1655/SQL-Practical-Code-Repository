## SQL-Practical-Code-Repository
Welcome to my SQL Practical Code repository! This repository is dedicated to housing my practical SQL code as I learn and master various SQL concepts. Each code example is designed to demonstrate a specific SQL concept or technique, accompanied by explanations in the README file. Additionally, you will find comprehensive case studies that apply these concepts to real-world scenarios.
